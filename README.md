# Homework_06-Weather_Dashboard

Hello - This repository will serve as homework #6 submission to the UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp. This assignment is intended to engage the student in writing JavaScript by calling REST APIs to create a weather dashboard that provides users with current and future weather forecasts.  The dashboard also saves the users search history, which can be retreieved when browser is closed. 

I used the OpenWeather API to call weather data based on the user search.  

I incorported the moment.js library to work with the current time. 

Additionally, the UV Index will change color depending on the level of UV Radiation for that day.
